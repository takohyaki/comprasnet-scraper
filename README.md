# ComprasNet Scraper

This repository contains code to scrape data and download files from the ComprasNet website. The script automates the process of extracting data from the "Anexos dos Itens" and "Anexos de Proposta/Habilitação" sections, saving the data in CSV files and downloading the relevant files.
